# Linkedin profile of IT Brazilians

**This section is where you can find other Brazilians that already work with IT in NZ. It will be added only the linkedin profile.**

PS: Smart rules to reach out other Brazilians.
1. Be polite everyone deserve it.
2. No one MUST do anything, if they do it go for you.
3. Never start a conversation with "Can you give me a job?"
4. Inviting a person for a coffee/beer, it will help you to create empathy.
5. Better than asking for something is to create a real networking.
