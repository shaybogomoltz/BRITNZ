Mission: To connect Brazilians that work with IT at NZ and help those who want to become one.

- [Companies that usually don't advertise on Seek/Trademe](/Companies_that_usually_dont_advertise_on_SeekTrademe.md)<br />
- [Companies IT recruiting related](/Companies_IT_recruiting_related.md)<br /> 
- [Linkedin profile of IT Brazilians](Linkedin_profile_of_IT_Brazilians.md) (That actually works with IT)<br />
- [Groups](Groups.md) (Whatsapp, Facebook, Slack...)<br />
