# IT_BR_NZ

Mission: Connect Brazilians who work with IT in NZ and help those who want to become one.

So far we got those sections:

- [Linkedin profile of IT recruiters](/Linkedin_profile_of_IT_recruiters.md)
- [Companies that usually don't advertise on Seek/Trademe](/Companies_that_usually_dont_advertise_on_SeekTrademe.md)
- [Companies IT recruiting related](/Companies_IT_recruiting_related.md) 
- [Linkedin profile of IT Brazilians](Linkedin_profile_of_IT_Brazilians.md) (That actually works with IT)
- [Groups](Groups.md) (Whatsapp, Facebook, Slack...)
